This is the suggested template for new EIPs.

Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less. It should not repeat the EIP number in title, irrespective of the category. 

## Abstract:
This EIP defines the interface for building decentralised certification registry for smart contracts via peer review.

## Motivation
Currently there has been lack of standard in the ethereum to give digital certificates to the smart contracts based on the validation of the community, with respect to the initiatives that are being taken in the verifying the accounts (EOA or smart contract based standards like (EIP-4337)[./eip-4337.md]). 

We take inspiration from the success from web2 projects  like [PGP],[TLS] for building trustless and secure identification of the certificates and avoiding the root of trust failure, something that current web3 protocols are facing issues due to the dependence on the offchain certificates and security audits for their validation, something that is time consuming to validate. 

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
